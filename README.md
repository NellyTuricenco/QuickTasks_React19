# QuickTasks (React19)
A modern task tracker app built with React 19 (canary) and TypeScript.  
This project is designed to explore and practice the latest React 19 features using Vite.

#FEATURES PRACTICED
- `useOptimistic` — Instant task rendering before async resolution
- `useFormStatus` — Track and disable submit button during submission
- `useActionState` — Handle async form actions with built-in state
- `use()` Hook — Suspense-based data loading
- `<DocumentHead>` — Set page metadata dynamically
- React Router — Multi-page app (`/` and `/task/:id`)
- TypeScript — Full type safety
- Component-driven architecture
